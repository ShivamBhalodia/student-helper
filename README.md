# Student Helper

Web Application for Students.

## Getting Started

• Built using React, Node.js REST API, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase.<br>
• Three functionalities Platform for knowledge sharing, Store for trading college stuff, SPI/CPI calculator at single place.<br>
• Filtering options like University, Tag, etc for viewing interested data.<br>
• Integrated Google Maps for easy trading, Chat for betterinteraction.<br>
• Managed State using Redux and followed MVC Architecture.

# User Flow and Functionality

• There is single login and register for all of the functionality<br>
• For the StudentHelper Network without login users can see all the posts on the platform but for the upvote or downvote post, comment on post they have to login.<br>
• They will have an option to sort data according to a particular category(tag likes academics, placement, general, etc.) and also can search from the search bar and filter data for any particular university.<br>
• They can post any questions on the platform and add tags to that question according to the relevance of the question.<br>
• For the StudentHelper Store without login users can see all the products on the platform but for the making request for any Product or To sell/buy any product they have to login.
• They will have an option to sort data according to a price, date of product posted, category of the product, users also can search from the search bar and filter data for any particular university.<br>
• User can make a request for a product which he/she wants to buy and the owner of the product can accept or reject the request, If he/she accepts request then all other requests on that product will automatically be deleted and that product will go to trade history of both sellers and buyers.<br>
• For the StudentHelper Calculator there is no need to login at all, students have to simply search for the first few letters of a particular subject and they will be given auto suggestions, from that they can choose a particular subject and after that just simply enter grade they got in that subject.<br>
• After adding all subjects they can calculate SPI/CPI with just one click.<br>
• We also added other functionalities like Save Post, and real-time chat with other users, etc.<br>


# Problems Solved

• We tried to solve three problems in a single place, which we faced as students.<br>
• The first one was that there is not even a single platform via which students can get updated with the current activities in their college, or ask doubt regarding academics or other campus activities. So our knowledge sharing platform(StudentHelper Network is built for that).<br>
• Second one was that we also don't have any platform for exchaingin old college stuff with seniors and juniors, What we used to do is we make whatsapp groups and via that group we contact each others, but this is not a convinenct way, because everyone has to go through all the messages and because of this some good deals might be missed. So our trading platform(StudentHelper Store is built for that).<br> 
• The third one is that in our college we don't get directly SPI/CPI in the result, College only sends Grades of particular subjects and we have to remember credit of each subject and from that, we have to calculate SPI/CPI, It is not difficult for the current semester, but what if we want to calculate for the previous semester? It is not possible to remember the credit of every subject we studied till the date. So our SPI/CPI calculator is built for that.<br>
